General info:
1) del() doesn't null the object but just calls the __del__, so you must directly item[someidx] = nil. it will also not work for class attributes.

CC:T info:
1) mod uses java gc so it doesn't call __gc on cleanup, so it will also not call __del__.

TODO:
 1) slices are separate lists, so a[::] = [] will do nothing. maybe create a.___slice_asgn(slice, item) which will replace slice assignment in compilator
 2) make error handler
 3) make "iterators" as pyobjects
